# Future Expansion ‚Äì Continued
A continuation of Sullien's [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/Sullien) great ‚Äì and, now, defunct ‚Äì [Future Expansion](https://github.com/Sullien/Future-Expansion) for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv).

This continued version merely fixes syntax to comply with Unciv's latest updates.

Sullien's mention of this in his original description is very subtle, so I believe it's worth pointing out: this mod is intended for use with the Gods & Kings ruleset.
## Discord
* Unciv's Discord server: [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/586194543280390151?color=%237289DA&logo=discord&logoColor=%23FFFFFF)](https://discord.gg/bjrB4Xw)

        * [Future Expansion category](https://discord.com/channels/586194543280390151/1020909710871887913), opened by Sullien himself.
## Alternative Uploads and Versions
My first and foremost aim with this reupload has always been preservation.  
I love playing Unciv with Sullien's mod and was really frustrated when later versions of the game broke it.

In the spirit of preservation, I believe multiple reuploads, mirrors and every other form of redundancy are not merely positive, but, indeed, needed, always.  
This is, after all, the beauty and strenght of open-source: the unlimited potential for collaboration between all and every person who's willing to contribute.

The documentation now includes [a list of all other versions of Future Expansion I know of](docs/alternative_versions.md).  
I'll be glad to add any others that are reported to me.
## WiP Warning
**This mod is still a WiP, limited by my currently restricted knowledge of Unciv, the original expansion mod and even the .json format or the game code.  
I can't guarantee its stability or usability in-game.  
I'll do my best to address any received feedback.  
Thanks in advance for your patience and tolerance.**

Many thanks to Lodo the Bear [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/46xAeu5.png">](https://discordapp.com/users/lodothebear) [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/SpacedOutChicken) for all the help with these! üôÇ

#### [Foreword](docs/forewords.md#414).
Documentation now contains a file [listing all other versions of Future Expansion I know of](docs/alternative_versions.md).
### 4.1.3.2
I'm an idiot and actually forgot a .json, because it was on a subfolder. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
### 4.1.3.1
Corrections to some file links.

* All comments left by Sullien within the .json have been moved to [a separate file](docs/authors_comments.md).

[I recently learned it's written in Kotlin](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/issues/11689#issuecomment-2150907477), so I went back and tried to change the mistakes I made in the documentation.

* Corrected a few minor syntax errors.
## Original Mod Description
Mod that greatly expands the late-game eras, with a focus on Atomic, Information and Future eras.

The main objective is to prevent the late-game from feeling stale by introducing new units, improvements and mechanics. 

While this mod extends game length, the goal is to not extend it too long. If you have any feedback/suggestions feel free to contact me.
