<h2>Attempting to fix 4.1!</h2>

v4.1 ('MOD-ern Times' Edition) had some functionalities broken by latest Unciv updates.  
Sullien's [commited to v5.0](https://discord.com/channels/586194543280390151/1020909710871887913/1117652119256838155), so most likely not fixing any issues on older versions.

I SUCK at JS, but perhaps I can tackle the issues and fix the mod.  
Here goes nothing! 😐
