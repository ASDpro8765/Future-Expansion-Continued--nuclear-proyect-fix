# Future-Expansion

Mod that greatly expands the Atomic, Information and Future eras.

The main objective is to prevent the late-game from feeling stale by introducing new units, improvements and mechanics. 

This mod does not add new eras. Information/Future eras are still meant to be for wrapping up the game.
