3# Future-Expansion

Mod that greatly expands the late-game eras, with a focus on Atomic, Information and Future eras.

The main objective is to prevent the late-game from feeling stale by introducing new units, improvements and mechanics. 

While this mod extends game length, the goal is to not extend it too long. If you have any feedback/suggestions feel free to contact me.
