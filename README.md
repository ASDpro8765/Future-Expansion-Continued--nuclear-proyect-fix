# Future Expansion – Continued
A continuation of [@Sullien](https://github.com/Sullien)'s great – and, now, defunct – [Future Expansion](https://github.com/Sullien/Future-Expansion) for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv).

This continued version merely fixes syntax to comply with Unciv's latest updates.

Sullien didn't mention this in his original description, so I believe it's worth mentioning: this mod is intended for use with the Gods & Kings ruleset.
## Alternative Uploads and Versions
My first and foremost aim with this reupload has always been preservation.  
I love playing Unciv with Sullien's mod and was really sad when later versions of the game broke it.

In the spirit of preservation, I believe multiple reuploads, mirrors and every other form of redundancy are not merely positive, but, indeed, needed, always.  
This is, after all, the beauty and strenght of open-source: the unlimited potential for collaboration between all and every person who's willing to contribute.

This is a list of all other available versions of Future Expansion I know of.  
I'll be glad to add any others that are reported to me.

### Other Reuploads
* [@calrissian-tendra](https://github.com/calrissian-tendra)'s [reupload](https://github.com/calrissian-tendra/Future-Expansion/commits/main/), originally from 2023/07/21.
* [@EmperorPinguin](https://github.com/EmperorPinguin)'s [reupload](https://github.com/EmperorPinguin/Future-Expansion-2022-09-18), originally from 2023/09/21.
* [@Gospedius](https://github.com/Gospedius)' [fork](https://github.com/Gospedius/Sullys-Future) of EmperorPinguin's reupload.
### Modified
* [Mr-Chubz](https://github.com/Mr-Chubz)'s [version](https://github.com/Mr-Chubz/Future-Edited), made to be compatible with [Warfare Edited](https://github.com/Mr-Chubz/Warfare-Edited).  
Incidentally, this is the oldest extant fork of Sullien's original repo and, therefore, due to the way GitHub works, the one some reuploads (mine included) inherited as "upstream".
### Unreleased
* In June of 2023, Sullien released [a preview of his future plans for Future Expansion](https://discord.com/channels/586194543280390151/1020909710871887913/1117652119256838155) in the form of [a RAR file containing his latet .json](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1020909710871887913/1117652118938062949/Future_Expansion_PE_TEST_BETA.rar?ex=669298e6&is=66914766&hm=dda58f07e48623897bdbcb6daa2d89c923b75a411349983117e6ab1672ba117a&).
I've corrected a few syntax typos and [uploaded it](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Unreleased) for preservation and reference.
* [My modded version of the expansion](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Enhanced) is still unreleased, as I'm still doing basic tests on it.
### Taken Down
Much like [the original mod](https://github.com/Sullien/Future-Expansion), some reuploads have been taken down, but I'm listing them below, just in case.
* [@Wheelchair](https://github.com/Wheelchair2)'s [temporary copy](https://github.com/Wheelchair2/Future-Expansion-Temporary-Copy).
* There was a reupload by [@SpacedOutChicken](https://github.com/SpacedOutChicken), but I lost the URL for it.
## WiP Warning
**This mod is still a WiP, limited by my currently restricted knowledge of Unciv, the original expansion mod and even the .json format or the game code.  
I can't guarantee its stability or usability in-game.  
I'll do my best to address any received feedback.  
Thanks in advance for your patience and tolerance.**

## Changelog
Forewords to some updates are on [a separate file](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Continued/blob/main/forewords.md).
### 4.1.3.2
I'm an idiot and actually forgot a .json, because it was on a subfolder.
### 4.1.3.1
Corrections to some file links.
### 4.1.3
Documentation and comments changes:
* All comments left by Sullien within the .json have been moved to [a separate file](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Continued/blob/main/authors_comments.md).
* All forewords to updates are now contained on [a separate file](https://github.com/denismattos/Future-Expansion-Continued/blob/main/forewords.md).
* Due to my inexperience, I wrongly believed Unciv was written in JS because it uses .json.  
[I recently learned it's written in Kotlin](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/issues/11689#issuecomment-2150907477), so I went back and tried to change the mistakes I made in the documentation.
### 4.1.2
Alien Monolith now converts base terrain to desert, to comply with Unciv's current syntax. 
### 4.1.1
* Changed instant building abilities uniques values to comply with Unciv's current syntax.
* Corrected a few minor syntax errors.
## Original Mod Description
Mod that greatly expands the late-game eras, with a focus on Atomic, Information and Future eras.

The main objective is to prevent the late-game from feeling stale by introducing new units, improvements and mechanics. 

While this mod extends game length, the goal is to not extend it too long. If you have any feedback/suggestions feel free to contact me.
